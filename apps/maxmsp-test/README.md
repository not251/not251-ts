# MaxMsp Test Project

It is an instance of [this template](https://github.com/aptrn/maxmsp-ts-example) with [**"@my-username/my-library**](https://github.com/aptrn/maxmsp-ts-library-template/tree/main/packages/my-library) as a dependency.

It can be used to test your library in Max directly.

Differences from the template:

- The `package.json` file is configured to use the `"@my-username/my-library` dependency from the workspace.
- The `maxmsp.config.json` file is configured to use the `"@my-username/my-library` dependency.
