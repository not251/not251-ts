# not251 concept

The theoretical assumptions of our research come from a profound study of traditional harmony theory, compositional and performance practices, modal theory, and the more recent pitch-class set theory. Through the tools of algebra and their computer implementations, our attempt is to formulate and propose a formal music language that transcends cultural aspects, allowing for the creation, communication and observation of musical phenomena in a compact, comprehensive, parametric way.
The possible applications of this kind of language are multiple:

- creative/compositional;
- educational;
- therapeutic;
- research.
