title: Division of the Octave

In the 12-TET equal temperament used in Western music, we divide the octave into 12 equidistant semitones, which express the minimum possible distance between two adjacent sounds. In other systems, this number may vary and non-equidistant values may be selected. In the algorithm, all manipulations that involve an octave shift imply a progressive addition or subtraction of this parameter.
