## Basics

In the Western system, a scale is a (ascending or descending) succession of sounds that proceed by adjacent degrees, or by intervals of a second and with adjacent names.
In our algorithm, the scale is an array of integers containing the distances between the degrees and the generating sound (fundamental), expressed in semitones.

<p>Major scale:</p> <p> 0 2 4 5 7 9 11 </p>

## Alternative

It is also possible to express scales through the distances between one degree and another.

<p>Major scale:</p> <p>2 2 1 2 2 2 1 </p>
